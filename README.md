# NBA Stats Project integrated with chatGPT as a web app.

### Intro

#### This project was started because I spent countless hours and opened hundreds of tabs on the ESPN website to look at stats for players before making my bets online. The goal of this project will scrape data into a CSV file nightly and then interface chatGPT to parse the data and show the results in a web app. The app will not only display averages for players for the season, but it will also display individual game stats and attempt to identify patterns and make recommendations on legs for parlay betting.

### Goal

#### Eventually, this will be behind a paywall charging a small fee for a monthly subscription. Some sites that offer data or bets charge crazy amounts of money and you don't know who you can trust and the users will know it is not a scam. Use this app at your own risk. Suggestions are made without a guarantee and is not responsible for any suggestions that aren't met for any game. Data will be provided and users can adjust their bets based on that data if they choose.
